htmlcxx - html and css APIs for C++

Description
-----------

This is a simple non-validating html and css parser for C++.
Although there are several other html parsers available, htmlcxx has some
characteristics that make it unique:

	* STL like navigation of DOM tree, using excelent's tree.hh library 
	  from Kasper Peeters
	* It is possible to reproduce exactly, character by character, the 
	  original document from the parse tree
	* Bundled css parser
	* Optional parsing of attributes	
	* C++ code that looks like C++

The parsing politics of htmlcxx are very simple, and almost no effort is done
to correct invalid html. The focus of the library is not speed, but it is
fast enough for most needs.

Enjoy!
